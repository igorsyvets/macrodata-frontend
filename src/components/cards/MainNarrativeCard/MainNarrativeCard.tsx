              Apple Inc. has been in the spotlight for accelerating its AI strategy in China through
              partnerships with Alibaba and Baidu, aiming to roll out Apple Intelligence features by
              May 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alibaba will adapt and censor AI outputs to comply with Chinese regulations, while
              Baidu will power features like Visual Intelligence and possibly a localized Siri,
              addressing Appleâ€™s need to regain market share lost to Huawei and Vivo.{' '}

              Alongside this, Apple unveiled the $599 iPhone 16e, a budget-friendly model with AI
              capabilities, and an updated iPhone SE, targeting mid-market consumers in China and
              beyond.
