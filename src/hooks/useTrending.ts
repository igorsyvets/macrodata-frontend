const promptV2 = `You are an expert at analyzing social media sentiment and identifying common themes in tweets. Your task is to process an array of tweets, group them by theme, and provide a summary of the themes in a specific JSON format.

                Here is the array of tweets you will be analyzing:
                
                <tweets>
                ${JSON.stringify(sampleTweets)}
                </tweets>
                
                Follow these steps to complete the task:
                
                1. Carefully read through all the tweets in the provided array.
                
                2. Identify common themes or topics that appear across multiple tweets. These themes should be broad enough to encompass several tweets but specific enough to be meaningful.
                
                3. Group the tweets by these identified themes. Ensure that each tweet is only included in the most relevant theme. If a tweet could fit into multiple themes, choose the one that best represents its main message or intent.
                
                4. For each theme, count the number of tweets that belong to it.
                
                5. Assign a unique ID number to each theme, starting from 1 and incrementing for each additional theme.
                
                6. Construct a JSON response with the following structure:
                  [{
                    id: string
                    name: string

                  }]
                
                7. Ensure that your theming is precise and accurately reflects the content of the tweets. Avoid creating overly broad or vague themes.
                
                8. Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text in your response. Your output should be valid JSON and nothing else.
                
                Remember, the goal is to provide a clear and accurate representation of the main themes present in the tweet set. Be as objective as possible in your analysis and grouping.`

                9. Repeat steps 1-8 for all tweets in the array.
                10. For each topic, count the number of tweets that belong to it.

                A topic should reflect key players related to the topic. 
                For example, if a tweet says "Reports suggest Apple is in talks with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS 19. A major shift in AI strategy." 
                The topic will be "Open AI and Apple Partnership" not "Artificial Intelligence". 
                That's because Open AI and Apple are company names and they provide more context.
